Photo Annotation is an android application, where we can annotate on a picture by performing various tasks. We can draw on the screen with different colors, take a picture through real time camera and have the image/picture appear on the screen. At this point when we have our picture on the screen, we can still draw on the picture by picking up different colors. We can resize the colors (color brush size) by selecting the slider which appears on the bottom of the screen. If a user wants to undo a line on a screen, there is an undo button which will erase the last line drawn by user. A user can clear all the paintings on the screen by clicking the garbage button on the bottom right side of the screen. That will essentially erase every color on the screen and retrieve the original image captured through camera.

Extra Feature:
1.	 (Color Picker) Multiple colors, users get to choose which color they would like to draw in, on the screen. 
2.	Users can undo an action, for example if they did not like the drawing pattern they can undo that pattern. 

The online sources were mainly stack over flow, watching videos about different features of android studio and the documentation of android studio.
